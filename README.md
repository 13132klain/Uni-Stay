This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
# Replace the URL with the one GitHub provides for YOUR repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git

# Push your committed code from your local 'main' branch to the 'origin' remote on GitHub
git push -u origin main
